The key idea is simple. Just like HTML is more expressive than plain text, a programming language which has table, image, video and so on can be more expressive than existing languages, most of which are based on plain text. </p> </article> <article><time>2017-04-30</time> <p>I need a structural S-expression editor to write scheme program!</p> </article> <article><time>2017-03-05</time> <p>I am recently studying assembly. After doing some searches, I decided to start with MISP. I prefer RISC over CISC because of my preference for simplicity. And I prefer MIPS over other RISC assemblies (e.g. SPARC, RISC-V) because I found a free/libre tutorial on it. Here is the link to that tutorial.</p> <p><a href="http://chortle.ccsu.edu/AssemblyTutorial/index.html">Programmed Introduction to MIPS Assembly Language</a></p> </article> <article><time>2017-01-09</time> <p>Files are encoding of data structures. They should be decoded back to data structure before any other operations at higher levels. In another words, it is irrational to operate directly on strings in the files. </p> </article> <article><time>2016-11-26</time> <p>It seems that gene or gene cluster may `lock' other genes or gene clusters. The locking can be achieved through miRNA silence, DNA heterochromatinization or depressor. Can we find out the locking network?</p> </article> <article><time>2016-11-26</time> <p>Generally, two types of signaling are required: broadcast and point-to-point communication. For cells of an multi-cellular animal, hormone acts as broadcast signal while neural impulse as point-to-point one. Point-to-point approach can be simulated by combining broadcasting and filtering, however, the former seems more efficient. </p> </article> <article><time>2016-11-11</time> <p>A bad day with Scheme is much better than a good day with C/C++. And I had a bad day with C++. Sad.</p> </article> <article><time>2016-11-10</time> <p>Expressiveness of programming language matters. As programmers tend to write shorter code, they prefer paradigms easier to express in the programming language. In other words, a language which has limited expressiveness is likely to prevent its users from paradigms that are easy to think of but hard to express.</p> </article> <article><time>2016-10-19</time> <p>Love is a Fallacy (written by Max Shulman) is so funny!</p> </article> <article><time>2016-10-19</time> <p>If I can find out the origin of each base in genomes, horizontal transferred sequences will emerge.</p> </article></article><footer xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"><img alt="Creative Commons License" style="border-width:0" src="https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-sa/4.0/88x31.png" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct="http://purl.org/dc/terms/" property="dct:title">This website</span> by <a xmlns:cc="http://creativecommons.org/ns#" href="https://kelvinlu1024.github.io" property="cc:attributionName" rel="cc:attributionURL">Kuangchen Lu</a> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>. </footer></body></html>
